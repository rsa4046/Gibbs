A reprinted typeset version of ``On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous
Substances'', originally published in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy,
III. pp. 108--248, Oct. 1875/May 1876, and pp. 343--524, May, 1877/July, 1878,
all by Josiah Willard Gibbs.

LaTeX typeset sources were originally prepared by W. Craig Carter and Michael A.
Gibson, whose repo I unfortunately can no longer locate. This current version contains some
corrections to source, equations, etc., but retains their original LaTeX class file.
